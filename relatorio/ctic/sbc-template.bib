  abstract = {This paper presents an architecture description language (ADL) called
	ArchC, which is an open-source SystemC-based language that is specialized
	for processor architecture description. Its main goal is to provide
	enough information, at the right level of abstraction, in order to
	allow users to explore and verify new architectures, by automatically
	generating software tools like simulators and co-verification interfaces.
	ArchCâ€™s key features are a storage-based co-verification mechanism
	that automatically checks the consistency of a refined ArchC model
	against a reference (functional) description, memory hierarchy modeling
	capability, the possibility of integration with other SystemC IPs
	and the automatic generation of high-level SystemC simulators and
	assemblers. We have used ArchC to synthesize both functional and
	cycle-based simulators for the MIPS and Intel 8051 processors, as
	well as functional models of architectures like SPARC V8, TMS320C62x,
	XScale and PowerPC.},
